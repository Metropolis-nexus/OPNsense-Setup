# OPNsense-Setup

![Dashboard](Dashboard.png)

## Virtual bridge

Node name -> Network -> Create a second virtual bridge with IP address 192.168.1.2. Check on "VLAN aware".

![Bridge](Bridge.png)

## Create OPNsense VM

Create OPNsense VM as usual, note that:
- OPNsense is FreeBSD, not Linux, so mark the OS as "other".
- OPNsense supports QEMU guest agent, so make sure that checkbox is ticked.
- OPNsense does not support Secure Boot, so uncheck pre-enrolled keys for system settings.
- Use vmbr0 for networking.
- Do not start the VM after creation.

## Network & Firewalling

- Node name -> Hardware -> Add a second network interface bridging to the new virtual bridge.

![net1](net1.png)

- Node name -> Firewall -> IPset
    - Create ipfilter-net0 -> Add all public IP addresses OPNsense is supposed to handle (Basically, all public IPs except those of iDRAC and Proxmox).
    - Create ipfilter-net1 -> 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1.

- Node name -> Firewall -> Add approprieate firewall rules

![Proxmox firewall](Proxmox-Firewall.png)

**Note**: These firewall rules will stop VMs behind OPNsense from *initiating* any non TCP, UDP, and ICMP connections.

- Firewall -> Options -> Enable Firewall, Router Advertisement, and IP filter

## OPNSense installation

Install OPNsense as usual, note that:
- Use UFS as the filesystem, as the VM itself already runs inside of a ZVOL.
- Go without swap on SSD.
- The default password for both the root and installer user is "opnsense".

## Configure interfaces

- Open console and configure interfaces. Note that by default OPNsense sets net0 as "LAN" and net1 as "WAN", which is the opposite of what we want.
- Open shell and run `pfctl -d` to temporarily disable the packet filter.
- Add the following rules to make sure the web interface is reachable on WAN:
